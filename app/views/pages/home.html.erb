<h2>About</h2>
<p>This Infrastructure Checklist is a quick guide to the documentation, systems, policies, 
procedures, and support mechanisms that nonprofit organizations should have in 
place to comply with the law, and to function effectively, efficiently, and 
transparently. The Checklist is focused on WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE IN PLACE rather 
than HOW you should utilize those systems/processes. For the HOW TO, we 
recommend you consult the Guidelines & Principles for Nonprofit Excellence in 
Nebraska & Iowa or the Assessment Tool. </p>
