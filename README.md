The Nonprofit Association of the Midlands provides a series of checklists (interactive PDFs) that nonprofit organizations can use to assess their own infrastructure along a variety of areas, taking into account both legal requirements and accepted best practices. Create a web application that recreates this process. At bare minimum, nonprofits should be able to fill out the form and receive a report at the end (telling them how they scored in each area, what legal requirements they are not currently meeting, and how they answered overall). Additional feature: each checklist item should link to a semi-static page (preferably rendered from Markdown) with more information and relevant links.
